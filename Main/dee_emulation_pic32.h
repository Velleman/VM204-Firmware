 * Overview:        This routine finds the current page and performs a backward search to find

 *                  reading a 0xFFFF in the address region. The returned value can be added
 *                  to the first address in page to compute the available address. A return
 *                  value of 0xFFFF means the entire page was filled which is an error condition.
 *                  This routine can be called by the user to determine how full the current
 *                  page is prior to a pack.
